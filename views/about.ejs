<h1>Who I am?</h1>

<p>Helo, I'm <b>Aung Ko Ko Khant</b>, a travel enthusiast with a passion for exploring new places and capturing beautiful moments along the way. While I am not a professional photographer, I enjoy taking photos to preserve memories and share my experiences with others.</p>

<h2>My Travel Experience</h2>
<p>Starting in November 2024, I embarked on an unforgettable journey across Thailand, visiting some of its most famous destinations, including Phuket, Chiang Mai, and several other renowned locations. Over the course of more than three months, I documented my adventures through photography, and every photo in these albums is entirely my own. I hold full copyright over them.</p>

<h2>Photography Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Photography, for me, is a way to tell stories and relive the joy of travel. I am not a professional photographerâ€”just someone who loves capturing the beauty of the world. My photos may not be technically perfect, but they reflect my personal experiences and emotions.</p>

<h2>Enjoy the Albums!</h2>
<p>These albums are created simply for fun, and I hope they bring you as much joy as they brought me while taking them. Whether they remind you of your own travels or inspire future adventures, I am delighted to share them with you. Enjoy!</p>
